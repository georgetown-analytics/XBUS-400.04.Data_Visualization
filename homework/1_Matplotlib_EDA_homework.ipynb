    "# Homework 1 &mdash; Exploratory Data Analysis with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learned during the first week of the course, data visualization is a critical component of exploratory data analysis (EDA) that can help you quickly familiarize yourself with the data, as well as identify any outliers or missing values in your dataset. In this homework assignment, you will get a chance to put your new Python and matplotlib skills to use by creating some of the new chart types you learned during class to explore the Global Superstore dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Global Superstore is a fictional international retail chain that sells office supplies to customers across the globe. The original dataset was stored in Excel and contained three sheets&mdash;`Orders`, `People`, and `Returns`. However, for this assignment you will only need to work with the sales data from the `Orders` sheet, where each row represents a single transaction. So that you can use pandas `read_csv()` function, the data from the `Orders` sheet has been saved as a separate CSV file (`\"global_superstore_orders.csv\"`) and is saved on Canvas in the `Datasets/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, start by importing the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. Additional code has already been added for you that takes advantage of the method's optional `dtype` parameter to change the columns in the `col` list to a `\"category\"` dtype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, that depending on where you downloaded the CSV file to your local computer, you may need to modify the filepath that is passed to the `pd.read_csv()` method. For example, here the filepath assumes that you have saved the `\"global_superstore_orders.csv\"` file one level up in a directory named `datasets`. If you have stored the file in the same folder as your Jupyter notebook, then you would only need to pass the method the name of the file.\n",
